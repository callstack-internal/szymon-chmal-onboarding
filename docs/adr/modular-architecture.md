# ADR: Adoption of Modular Architecture

## Context
To improve maintainability, scalability, and ease of collaboration among development teams, we are adopting a modular architecture. In this architecture, the application is divided into discrete modules, each encapsulating specific functionality. All modules are stored in the /modules directory.
Key aspects of this modular architecture include:
- Each module contains an index.ts file that declares its public API.
- Other modules can import functionality from a target module exclusively through this index.ts file using the alias @/modules/target-module.
- Direct relative path imports to files within other modules or to files other than index.ts are strictly prohibited.
- Within a module, strictly relative path imports are encouraged to prevent circular dependencies and to maintain clear module boundaries.

## Decision
1. Module Structure: Each module will reside in the /modules directory and will contain its own index.ts file, which serves as the sole entry point for external imports.
2. Public API Exposure: The index.ts file will expose the public API of the module. Any external module that needs to use functionalities from the target module must import from this file using the alias @/modules/target-module.
3. Import Restrictions:
    - External Imports: Other modules are only allowed to import from the index.ts file of a target module using the alias @/modules/target-module.
    - Internal Imports: Within a module, imports should utilize relative paths to reference internal files, which helps prevent circular dependencies and maintains modular integrity.
4. Prohibited Practices:
    - Importing files from other modules using relative paths.
    - Importing files directly from other modules besides the index.ts entry point.

## Consequences

- Improved Maintainability: By clearly defining module boundaries and public APIs, the codebase becomes easier to understand and maintain.
- Enhanced Scalability: This architecture allows for easier scaling as modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
- Team Collaboration: Teams can work on different modules concurrently with minimal risk of conflicts or cross-module dependency issues.
- Clear Dependency Management: Restricting imports to the index.ts file ensures clear and manageable dependencies, reducing the risk of tight coupling and circular dependencies.
  Challenges:
- Initial Learning Curve: Developers will need to adapt to the new structure and import practices, which may initially slow down development.
- Refactoring Effort: Refactoring the existing codebase to fit this new architecture will require significant effort and thorough testing to ensure stability.
